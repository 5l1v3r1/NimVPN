NimVPN is a tool to automatically connect you to a random VPN in a country of your choice.  
It uses [openvpn](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn) to connect you to a server obtained from [VPN Gate](http://www.vpngate.net/en/).  
100% inspired by POSIX-based [autovpn](https://github.com/adtac/autovpn) and 200% ported to Windows and [Nim](http://nim-lang.org).
